1. As a beginner, which stack/framework (both frontend and backend) will be better to work with for API and cloud services? Some of the Azure services seem to work for python. What to do if I plan on developing with nextjs and nodejs?
2. Do I need to learn javascript for participating in api and cloud services ? because I know python .
3. Is Django backend viable for this Hackathon's API & Cloud section or express js would be better?
4. How much familiarity with the languages that will be used for the development (i.e., JavaScript with React and other stuff) do I have to be able to not get distracted by the task?
5. Please mention about the task we need to do during the API and cloud segment. And which language should I work with?
6. Can participating in hackathon with no expertise help us in the future? 
7. API & Cloud Services, DevOps, Web3 & Blockchain job opportunities
8. What are the resources in Bangla for API & Cloud Services, DevOps, Web3 & Blockchain?
9. APIs that provide accurate or expected results are often locked behind a paywall. So if we want to use free APIs, how can we ensure that those will be good, or at least provide a decent result?
10. Is it fruitful to start with cloud engineering or devops without any prior work experience on development?? 
11. I want to know about AWS, what is the future on it. If i learn aws, is it possible to get high level jobs? what are the segments in aws?
